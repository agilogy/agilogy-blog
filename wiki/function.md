A **mathematic function** from a set 𝕏 to a set 𝕐 assigns to each element of 𝕏 exactly one element of 𝕐. The set 𝕏 is called the domain of the function and the set 𝕐 is called the codomain of the function.

A **software function** 𝑓 is a [procedure](procedure) or [method](method) that given an argument (or a tuple of arguments) of type 𝕏 returns a value of type 𝕐 in a pure way, that is:

- Total: For any value x of type 𝕏, 𝑓(x) always returns some value y of type 𝕐
- Determinist: For any value x of type 𝕏, 𝑓(x) always returns the same value y of type 𝕐
- Pure: The invocation of 𝑓 has no observable effect other than calculating the result value and taking some time.
